##Details
This site was developed for my brother, Brandon Adam, who is a professional photographer. It is based off of startbootstrap.com template, specifically the 
"Agency" theme. The site is hosted [here](http://www.brandonadam.com). 
Although the website is visually very similar a lot of the functionality was changed. The portfolio modals were replaced with image galleries, a testimonial slider
was added, the 'team' section was removed entirely, and the 'about me' section re-formatted.
